              <p>Ruben Giosa's passion for vehicles started when he was only 10 years old in Argentina. He worked on anything he could get his hands on, and eventually fell in love with Mercedes Benz cars. To learn all he could, Ruben volunteered to do free work for two years under an apprenticeship. During this apprenticeship, Ruben received unparalleled education from a German Mercedes Benz engineer.</p>
              <p>Ruben came to the United States in 1970, and worked hard to acheive his goal. In 1978, Ruben's Imports was established in Dana Point, California. It started off strictly as a Mercedes Benz service shop, but eventually expanded to other luxury vehicles.</p>
              <p>What started off as Ruben's passion has now turned into a family affair. Rafael Bonetto, Ruben's son-in-law, manages Ruben's Imports alongside Ruben. Together, they have been serving Dana Point with exceptional service and have won multiple awards for customer satisfaction. Ruben's Imports is now celebrating over 35 years of success.</p>
